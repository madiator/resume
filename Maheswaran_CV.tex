  \end{list2}

  \textbf{Social-aware Data Diffusion} \hfill \textbf{Sep 2010 -- Present}
  \begin{list2}
   \item Some of the current data diffision strategies involve using mobility information to decide which data to diffuse. 
   \item Our work involves overlaying the social structure on top of the mobility information to perform social-aware data diffusion.
   \item Advised by Prof. Bhaskar Krishnamachari and Prof. Guohong Cao, PSU.
  \end{list2}
  \newpage
  \textbf{Implementation of MapReduce} \hfill \textbf{Feb 2010 -- Apr 2010}

  \item Implemented MapReduce (a framework for distributed processing) on USC's High-Performance Computing and Communications (HPCC) cluster consisting of thousands of nodes, as part of a course. 
  \item Used it to study huge network datasets. 
  \item Course (Computer Communications, CS551) advised by Prof. John Heidemann. 
  \end{list2}
 
  \textbf{Other projects} 
  \begin{list2}   
   \item Implementation of Nachos, a software that simulates a small OS, involving process management, memory management, interprocess communication, fault tolerance etc. for a course on Operating Systems.
   \item Flash Scheduling - proposed and analyzed a new scheduling algorithm in a multi-user communication system with varying number of users (term project for Computer Communications course).

    %%Over the period of around three months, I collected graph structure of Twitter comprising about two million nodes. This will be used to study the network structure of Twitter. Another aspect I investigated was an edge-evolution model on a fixed number of nodes in an Erd�s�R�nyi random graph where edges are added and deleted based on the similarity between nodes. A problem I recently started to look into is �Contact Processes�, where I try to fit models (markov models to begin with) for state changes of humans so as to match the observed contact processes between individuals.

    \textsl{Summer Internship} \hfill \textbf{May 2011 -- Aug 2011}
    \begin{list2}
    \item Developed a new inter-vehicular video sharing application based on GM's existing Wavecast system for vehicular communication.
    \item Integrated erasure coding into the application for faster distributed file downloads. 
    \item Additionally, developed an Android application to act as the front end (which connects to and controls the Linux based video sharing application wirelessly).
    \end{list2}
    

    \textbf{University of Southern California}, Los Angeles\\%\vspace{1mm}\\\vspace{1mm}%
    \textsl{Summer Internship} \hfill \textbf{May 2007 -- July 2007}
    \begin{list2}
    \item Worked on the energy reduction of Wireless Sensor Networks using Compressed Sensing
    \item Compressed Sensing is used to integrate compression and sensing to achieve energy gains as high as 90\% in ideal conditions.
    \item The work involved using wavelet and DCT domains to perform compressed sensing to sense temperature. Sparse random projections were used to effectively reduce the number of communications to the sink. Methods for optimizing the projections were also investigated.
