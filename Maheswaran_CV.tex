    %%Over the period of around three months, I collected graph structure of Twitter comprising about two million nodes. This will be used to study the network structure of Twitter. Another aspect I investigated was an edge-evolution model on a fixed number of nodes in an Erd�s�R�nyi random graph where edges are added and deleted based on the similarity between nodes. A problem I recently started to look into is Contact Processes, where I try to fit models (markov models to begin with) for state changes of humans so as to match the observed contact processes between individuals.

    \textsl{Summer Internship} \hfill \textbf{May 2011 -- Aug 2011}
    \begin{list2}
    \item Developed a new inter-vehicular video sharing application based on GM's existing Wavecast system for vehicular communication.
    \item Integrated erasure coding into the application for faster distributed file downloads. 
    \item Additionally, developed an Android application to act as the front end (which connects to and controls the Linux based video sharing application wirelessly).

    \begin{list2}
    \item Worked on the energy reduction of Wireless Sensor Networks using Compressed Sensing
    \item Compressed Sensing is used to integrate compression and sensing to achieve energy gains as high as 90\% in ideal conditions.
    \item The work involved using wavelet and DCT domains to perform compressed sensing to sense temperature. Sparse random projections were used to effectively reduce the number of communications to the sink. Methods for optimizing the projections were also investigated.
